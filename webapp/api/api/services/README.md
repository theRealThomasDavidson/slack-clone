# Services Documentation

The services layer implements business logic following SOLID principles:
- **S**ingle Responsibility: Each service handles one specific domain
- **O**pen/Closed: Services are extendable without modification
- **L**iskov Substitution: Services can be replaced with derived implementations
- **I**nterface Segregation: Services expose only necessary methods
- **D**ependency Inversion: Services depend on abstractions (repositories)

## Authentication Service (`auth.py`)

Handles user authentication and session management. Follows Single Responsibility by focusing only on authentication concerns.

### Responsibilities
- User registration and validation
- Password hashing and verification
- JWT token generation and validation
- Session management
- Online status tracking

### Dependencies
- UserRepository for data access
- ConnectionManager for WebSocket handling
- Settings for configuration

## Channel Service (`channel.py`)

Manages channel operations and member access. Demonstrates Open/Closed principle through extensible channel types.

### Responsibilities
- Channel creation and configuration
- Member management
- Access control
- Channel state broadcasting
- Channel discovery

### Dependencies
- ChannelRepository for data access
- ConnectionManager for real-time updates
- AuthService for access validation

## Message Service (`message.py`)

Handles message operations and delivery. Shows Interface Segregation through focused message handling.

### Responsibilities
- Message creation and validation
- Message delivery
- Message history management
- Message formatting
- Real-time broadcasting

### Dependencies
- MessageRepository for storage
- ConnectionManager for broadcasting
- ChannelService for access checks

## File Service (`file.py`)

Manages file operations. Demonstrates Dependency Inversion through abstract storage handling.

### Responsibilities
- File upload handling
- File storage management
- Access control
- File metadata tracking
- File retrieval

### Dependencies
- FileRepository for metadata
- StorageHandler for file operations
- ChannelService for context
- AuthService for permissions

## Reaction Service (`reaction.py`)

Manages message reactions. Shows Single Responsibility through focused reaction handling.

### Responsibilities
- Reaction management
- Reaction validation
- Real-time updates
- Reaction cleanup
- Access control

### Dependencies
- ReactionRepository for storage
- MessageService for context
- ConnectionManager for updates

## Design Patterns Used

### Singleton Pattern
- Used in services that need global state
- Ensures single instance for resource management
- Example: ConnectionManager

### Repository Pattern
- Abstracts data storage
- Enables swappable implementations
- Used across all services

### Observer Pattern
- Used for real-time updates
- Implemented through WebSocket connections
- Decouples message sending from delivery

### Factory Pattern
- Used for creating complex objects
- Examples: message creation, file handling
- Ensures consistent object creation

## Error Handling

Each service implements:
- Input validation
- Access control checks
- Appropriate error responses
- Consistent error formats
- Proper error propagation

## Dependency Management

Services follow dependency injection:
- Dependencies declared in constructor
- No direct instantiation of dependencies
- Easy to mock for testing
- Configurable through DI container

## Extension Points

Each service provides extension points:
- Custom validators
- Custom formatters
- Event hooks
- Custom storage backends
- Custom authentication methods
